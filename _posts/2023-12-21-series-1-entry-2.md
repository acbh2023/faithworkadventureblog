`Introduction`

__TL;DR__ at the bottom

While writing today's entry after some inspiration on today's topic, "Leave The Past in The Past", I thought I had put myself in a bit of a box by calling this first series _Faith and Work_. I concluded that the series' title is still perfect for today's entry, because while there is not much discussion of my work in this entry, a big part of this blog is letting those in my professional world know who I am and what is truly important to me, my faith. I aspire to not be someone that lives in two separate worlds, to not keep faith and work divided; I aspire to put my faith first and allow it to inspire everything about me, especially my work.

That said, once again, whether you are a Christian or not, you are welcome here; everyone can relate to struggling with past mistakes. Let's dive in.

`Entry #2: Leave the Past in The Past`

__If the world ended today, would God tell me, "Well done, good and faithful servant"? (Matthew 25:23 ESV)__ I often fall into the temptation of failing to do God's work in the moment and instead focusing on planning future work for His Kingdom. While planning future work for God's Kingdom is good, I want and need to enact yesterday's Kingdom plans today, and manage my time well enough to be available for spontaneous Kingdom work. God help me to be this way.

__If the disciples preached that the end is near two thousand years ago, as followers of Christ shouldn't that be our mentality today?__ Live each day like it could be the last chance to share with your sibling, friend, or neighbor. There is so much work to do and such little time. But fret not, for "...with the Lord one day is as a thousand years" (2 Peter 3:8 ESV) _Translation: It is never too late to do God's will and spread His gospel, and with God on your side your impact is never too small_. Satan feeds us lies to try and counter those truths, because he knows the light fueling a follower of Jesus is dangerous to him and his kingdom, and wants you to _hide it under a bushel_. __NO!__ These discouragements often comes in the form of thoughts in our head such as:
- "The world is too far gone for me to make a difference."
- "What difference will sharing the gospel with this one person make?", "They don't have time for me anyway", "I don't want to bother them.", etc.

`DETOUR`

Notice how I framed the above thoughts in the first person. Just because we have a first person thought does not mean it is our own thought. Paul talked about the fact that even if we are redeemed in Christ, while we are still in the flesh sin is still in us but it is not _of_ us (Romans 7:20) like a thorn stuck in the flesh (2 Corinthians: 12:7-10). John Bunyan has an interesting way of framing this idea that I think is helpful to understanding that while we are redeemed in Christ, evil thoughts can still be planted in our head. That does not mean they are _our own_ thoughts.

For a little context of this particular John Bunyan's _Pilgrim's Progress_ passage, the main character, Christian, is walking through the Valley of the Shadow of Death at this point in his journey, a place where there is no light at all, so he cannot see anything. He walks through it entirely blindly, trusting God while his mind and soul are assaulted by demons:

"One thing I shouldn't forget to
mention is how poor Christian looked
so confused. As I watched him,
it was like he didn't even know his
own voice. Just when he came to the
mouth of the burning pit, one of the
wicked ones sneaked up behind him.
It whispered softly into his ear with
many suggestive and distressing
blasphemies. Christian thought these
blasphemies has originated from his
own mind, and it troubled him deeply.
As he continued on his journey, the
thought that he could possibly
blaspheme the One who loved him so
much weighed heavily on him. In fact,
it tested Christian more than anything
he had met with before. If he could
have helped it, he would not have
done it, but he didn't have the
foresight to either stop his ears or
understand the real source of the
blasphemies."

Another way I like to think about our mind is like an airport. If our mind is an airport, then thoughts are like airplanes. Your job is Air Traffic Control, and with the help of the Holy Spirit, which would be like Homeland Security, together you must determine which planes are safe to land in your airport. When a thought like "I am not worthy to preach the gospel" pops into your head, treat that like a plane asking permission to land. It hasn't landed yet so no sweat. But as soon as you start to accept that thought, you have just invited a plane full of insurgents into your airport. And there's no telling how deeply they will work their way into your world and the havoc they might wreak. "Take every thought captive to the obedience of Christ" (2 Corinthians 10:5 ESV). So the next time a thought that does not line up with your new identity as a new creation in Christ pops in your head, "Permission to land denied". Hand it over to Christ; he will take care of it for you. Don't try to take care of it on your own.


`End Detour`

__Continuing with our discussion about how it's never too late to build God's Kingdom and your work for Him is never too small:__

Reaching one person with the gospel may seem insignificant in a world where darkness appears to be winning (key word _appears_), but reaching that one person with the gospel, if they accept the gift, will not seem insignificant to them in eternity's eye. Remember the parable of the sower (Matthew 13:1-23, Mark 4:1-20, Luke 8:4-15), where __one__ seed planted in good soil produced fruit "in one case a hundredfold, in another sixty, and in another thirty" (Matthew 13:23 ESV).

There are many things that often distract me from the simple task of spreading the gospel, but it is also our most important task as Christians (Matthew 28:16-20). I know for me, one of those distractions is thinking I'm unworthy because of my past. I must rebuke those thoughts in Christ because they are not thoughts of a new creation in Christ. Recently, when I have been caught in the trap of drudging up my past in my thoughts, what Paul says in Phillipians 3:13-14 has been helping me. But before you read those verses (below), keep in mind the writer's background. Paul, before he was chosen to be an ambassador of Jesus, was a man responsible for playing a major role in a campaign to eradicate Christians. He was participating in an attempted genocide of Christians. If God used a former genocidaire of His people and turned him into one of His most important tools for His Kingdom, He can use anyone with a dark past and turn them into His vessel.

Forgetting what is behind and
straining toward what is ahead,
I press on toward the goal to
win the prize for which God
has called me heavenward in
Christ Jesus. (ESV)

I want you to note something about this verse. Forgetting here is not in the sense of when you forget that you had an appointment. The word forgetting here, in Greek, _epilanthanomenos_, means to neglect. You have to intentionally neglect the temptation to drudge up your past and pity yourself.

So put on the shoes of the gospel of peace and unhide that light from under that bushel! Spread the gospel, one person at a time.

And with that, I leave you with the same question I asked you at the beginning:

would God tell me, "Well done,

__TL;DR__ |Leave The Past in The Past. Paul says it this way: "Forgetting what is behind and straining toward what is ahead, I press on toward the goal to win the prize for which God has called me heavenward in Christ Jesus." (Phillipians 3:13-14 ESV)|
