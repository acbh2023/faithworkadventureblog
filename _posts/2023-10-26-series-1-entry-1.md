__WARNING:__ READING THE ENTRY BELOW MAY CAUSE COGNITIVE DISSONANCE

*read today's entry summarized at the bottom of page*

This is my first entry, and so I will start with an __introduction__ of myself, my intended __audience__, my __vision and purpose__ for this blog-style publication, and end with my __first official entry__.

`Introduction`

I am a follower of Jesus, and that is central to my life. I am also a father of 1 son, a husband of 1 wife, and professionally I am a Geographer and Grant Curator that uses technology to help my team and clients submit grants in the broadband industry. Enough about me.

`Audience`

I want to be clear, this is not for an exclusively Christian audience. That said, I will not hide the fact that I lead a Jesus-centric life, nor will I hide the fact that I hope to influence the reader to believe in Jesus and understand His love for you. I am here to nourish Christians and invite non-Christians to join us.

I also want non-Christians to be able to read the perspective of a Christian that is not just a nominal Christian but truly strives to follow Christ. There are too many fear-mongering, anti-biblical, or content creators on the internet today that are either Masquerading as Christians or are confused Christians and it is frustrating to see.

`Vision and Purpose`

This weekly, blog-style publication will be released every __Thursday__, and will include a variety of series on faith, my passions/work, and adventurous short stories. The series will all flow from my love for Christ, my love for my family, my love for strangers, and my passions, and my passion for adventure.

This __first series__, a 5-part series, will be focused on topics of __faith and/or work__, but will not necessarily always touch on both. The focus will be to help you decide if you really want to listen to me or not based on my attempt to convey my perspective to you.

The __second series__, which will have its first publication released on November 30th, 2023, will be an __adventure series__ about an adventurer named _Newt_ and his trusty steed _Shorty_. Leaving their hometown, they will run into trials, friends and foes as they make their journey through a wild, untamed land on their way to the coastline to board the Santa Vida. It will be like Pilgrim's Progress with a Western twist.

_I aim to be short and to the point most of the time_, and write with the purpose of encouraging, exhorting, and sometimes admonishing the reader to search for Truth, evaluate their priorities, and be driven to take action to be a doer of the Word of God and not just a hearer.

There should be a __summary/TL;DR__ _at the end of every entry_ if you don't have the time to read the whole thing.

`FIRST ENTRY: FAITH, ISRAEL AND THE END OF THE WORLD`

With Israel and its current conflict being on the forefront of the news these days, I find myself in state of existential pensiveness. What does this mean? What does it all mean??

Anytime something like this happens, I hear a thousand voices in the Christian community shouting: "THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF THE END!" Some panickedly, some excitedly.

I have _2 main points_ to make as these Israel at War stories dominate the news cycles:

__1. As a Christian, this type of potentially world-shifting event is a reminder to get back to work for and put first the Kingdom of God, and pray that God gives you ample time to reach as many as possible with the hope of Jesus.__

While God uses events like these to remind people of what's really important (He's used them in the past to remind me to get back on track with my faith), rarely when potentially world-shifting events occur do I hear these important sentiments mentioned in these Bible verses:

- _This may surpirse both Christian and non-Christian alike:_ __God desires all people be saved.__
{% highlight text %}
2 Peter 3:9 (ESV): The Lord is not slow to fulfill his promise as some count
slowness, but is patient toward you, not wishing that any should perish, but that
all should reach repentance.

{% endhighlight %}

- _What is the first thing ever God decides to personally reveal about His character to humanity?_

{% highlight text %}
Exodus 34:6 (ESV): The Lord passed before him and proclaimed, “The Lord, the Lord,
a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love and
faithfulness."
{% endhighlight %}

If you read on into Exodus 34:7, we see that God is also a God of Wrath. But He is a God of Mercy, Grace, Patience, exploding with steadfast love and faithfulness FIRST. Don't get it twisted.

- _Why did Jonah at first try to avoid God's command to go to Nineveh?_

{% highlight text %}
Jonah 4:2 (ESV): And he prayed to the Lord and said, “O Lord, is not this what I
said when I was yet in my country? That is why I made haste to flee to Tarshish;
for I knew that you are a gracious God and merciful, slow to anger and abounding in
steadfast love, and relenting from disaster."
{% endhighlight %}

Jonah knew God wanted to forgive the evil Ninevites, and Jonah hated the Nineveites and the evil things they had done to Israel and other nations. He wanted them to pay. God wanted to forgive them.

While we certainly should be excitedly anticipating Christ's coming as followers of Him, simultaneously let us put our noses to the grindstone and do the work of spreading the gospel, which is not just a message but a person, the God-man Jesus Christ. The end is always near, it has been near ever since Jesus' ascension after His resurrection; there is much work to do and so it is not the time to hunker down in our bunkers. *I believe these two verses support this sentiment:*

{% highlight text %}
- "The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few" (Matthew 9:37 ESV)
- "To live is Christ, and to die is gain" (Philippians 1:21 ESV)
{% endhighlight %}

While I would love to be in heaven, there is one thing I cannot do in heaven: *share the gospel of Jesus Christ with non-believers*. I pray for God to give me as much time as possible to reach as many people as possible.

__2. If you are an American and a Christian like myself: As a Christian First and an American Second, it is not most important be picking sides in this geopolitical conflict.__

- We do not have a bone to pick with earthly authorities.
{% highlight text %}
Ephesians 6:12 (ESV) says, "For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but
against the rulers, against the authorities, against the cosmic powers over this
present darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places."
{% endhighlight %}

- Geopolitical/Ethnic/Geneological Israel and Spiritual nation of Israel are two very different things.
{% highlight text %}
Romans 9:6-8 (ESV) says, "For not all who are descended from Israel belong to
Israel, and not all are children of Abraham because they are his offspring,
but 'Through Isaac shall your offspring be named.' This means that it is not the
children of the flesh who are the children of God, but the children of the
promise are counted as offspring."

There is a difference between Geneological Israel and Spiritual Israel (Romans 9:6-8) |

ps: I am working on getting email subscriptions setup so please hold on tight for that.
